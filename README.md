# wf-mpx | Mpox Virus Metagenomic Assembly

This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow for the
assembly of reads originating from the mpox virus obtained through
Oxford Nanopore metagenomic sequencing.




## Introduction

This workflow provides a simple way to analyse mpox sequencing data; taking
raw Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads and creating a draft consensus and assembly.

We expect data to be generated from a mixed population sample hence the use of the term "metagenomics".

> No trimming of sequences is carried out so be vigilant when using targeted data.

Using community-develped tools, this workflow:
* Maps reads to a reference genome (`minimap2`)
* Assesses coverage
* Discards reads not mapping to the chosen reference
* Calls variants with resepect to the reference (`medaka`)
* Filters variants with <20x coverage
* Creates a draft consensus (`bcftools`)
* Creats a de-novo assembly (`flye` & `medaka`)

More information can be found in this [blog post](https://labs.epi2me.io/basic-mpox-workflow).




## Quickstart

The workflow uses [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and
software resources, as such nextflow will need to be installed before attempting
to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or
[singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html) to provide isolation of
the required software. Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either docker or singularity is installed.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow.

**Workflow options**

To obtain the workflow, having installed `nextflow`, users can run:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-mpx --help
```

to see the options for the workflow.

**Workflow example**

To run the workflow with test data

```
git clone https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-mpx
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-mpx --fastq wf-mpx/test_data/fastq/barcode01
```

**Workflow outputs**

The primary outputs of the workflow include:

* a simple text file providing a summary of sequencing reads,
* an HTML report document detailing the primary findings of the workflow.
* a draft consensus sequence obtained
* a medaka polished assembly
