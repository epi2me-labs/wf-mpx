This workflow provides a simple way to analyse mpox sequencing data; taking
raw Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads and creating a draft consensus and assembly.

We expect data to be generated from a mixed population sample hence the use of the term "metagenomics".

> No trimming of sequences is carried out so be vigilant when using targeted data.
